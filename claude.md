# Triple Take - Project Documentation

A cooperative word-guessing party game based on Fishbowl/Monikers.

## Project Overview

Triple Take is a web-based party game where players guess words through three rounds with increasingly restrictive clues. The same words are used in all rounds, creating memorable moments as restrictions increase.

**Game Name:** Triple Take (repository may still be called "fishbowl")

### Game Mechanics

**Core Rounds:**
1. **Round 1 - Describe It**: Use any words or gestures (except the word itself)
2. **Round 2 - One Word**: Give only ONE word as a clue (can repeat it)
3. **Round 3 - Charades**: Act it out, no words allowed (sound effects OK)

**Optional Bonus Rounds:**
4. **Round 4 - Under the Bedsheet**: Act it out under a bedsheet
5. **Round 5 - Sound Effects Only**: Only sound effects, no words or acting

**Gameplay Flow:**
- Each player gets a turn (default 60 seconds, configurable: 30s-120s)
- Players pass a single device between turns (in-person mode)
- Round ends when ALL words have been guessed (may take many turns)
- Game continues through all selected rounds
- Cooperative scoring: track total words guessed, not competitive

**Key Features:**
- Skip words (they shuffle back into the deck randomly)
- Pause/resume functionality
- Turn-by-turn statistics
- Round-by-round breakdown
- Auto-save to LocalStorage

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development (strict mode enabled)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework (React/Vue/etc)
- **CSS with Custom Properties** - For theming and responsiveness
- **LocalStorage** - Game state persistence

### Design Principles
- **Jamstack approach**: Build upfront, serve from CDN
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design optimized for phones
- **No backend required**: Fully client-side (Phase 1)
- **Minimal dependencies**: Keep bundle size small
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without installation, PWA-ready

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Netlify (or any static host)
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Zero cost**: No server, no database, no API calls

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### State Management

**Centralized GameStateManager** (singleton pattern):
- Single source of truth for all game state
- Subscriber pattern for reactive UI updates
- Immutable state updates (copy-on-write)
- Auto-save to LocalStorage with debouncing (max once/second)

**Key State Methods:**
- `startNewGame(config, words)` - Initialize game
- `startTurn()` - Begin a new turn
- `markWordCorrect()` - Mark current word as guessed
- `skipWord()` - Shuffle word back into deck
- `updateTimer(remaining)` - Update countdown
- `pauseTurn()` / `resumeTurn()` - Pause functionality
- `endTurn()` - Record turn stats, increment turn number
- `completeRound()` - Finalize round, prepare next round or end game

### Screen Navigation

**ScreenManager** handles routing:
- Maps screen IDs to screen factory functions
- Supports both sync and async render methods
- Clears and re-renders on navigation

**Screen Flow:**
```
Welcome
  ↓
Setup (configure timer, select rounds)
  ↓
Word Input (built-in lists / paste / upload)
  ↓
Review (verify and edit word list)
  ↓
Round Intro (explain round rules)
  ↓
Turn Intro (pass device prompt) ←─┐
  ↓                                │
Play (60s timer, word display)     │
  ↓                                │
Turn End (turn stats) ─────────────┘ (repeat until all words guessed)
  ↓
Round End (round stats)
  ↓
[Next Round Intro or Game End]
  ↓
Game End (final results)
```

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Round Completion Logic

**Problem:** When the last word is guessed, multiple state updates happen:
1. `markWordCorrect()` removes word from `remainingWords`
2. `endTurn()` records turn stats
3. `completeRound()` refills words for next round

**Solution:** Check BEFORE calling `markWordCorrect()` if this is the last word:
```typescript
const willCompleteRound = stateBefore.remainingWords.length === 1;
getGameState().markWordCorrect();
if (willCompleteRound) {
  navigate('round-end');
}
```

#### Turn History Management

**Problem:** `endTurn()` needs to append to current round's history, not overwrite previous rounds.

**Solution:** Check if the last round history entry is for the current round:
```typescript
const isNewRound = !lastRoundHistory ||
  lastRoundHistory.roundNumber !== state.currentRound;

if (isNewRound) {
  // Append new round history entry
} else {
  // Update existing round entry with new turn
}
```

#### Skip Word Implementation

Words are shuffled back into a RANDOM position (not at the end):
```typescript
// Remove current word
const newRemaining = [...state.remainingWords];
newRemaining.splice(currentWordIndex, 1);

// Insert at random position
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * (newRemaining.length + 1));
newRemaining.splice(randomIndex, 0, currentWord);
```

This prevents word clustering and feels more natural.

## Design System

### Color Palette

**Light Mode:**
- Primary: `#6366f1` (Indigo)
- Secondary: `#ec4899` (Pink)
- Success: `#10b981` (Green) - "Got It!" button
- Warning: `#f59e0b` (Amber) - "Skip" button
- Error: `#ef4444` (Red)
- Background: `#ffffff`
- Surface: `#f9fafb`
- Text: `#111827`

**Dark Mode:** Automatically activated via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`

### Typography
- Font: System font stack (system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif)
- Sizes: sm(0.875rem), base(1rem), lg(1.25rem), xl(1.5rem), 2xl(2rem), 3xl(3rem)

### Spacing
- xs: 0.5rem, sm: 1rem, md: 1.5rem, lg: 2rem, xl: 3rem

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Large "Got It!" button for easy tapping during gameplay

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Timer precision
**Problem:** `setInterval` can drift over time
**Current:** Acceptable for party game use
**Future:** Could recalculate based on elapsed time for precision

### Issue: Multiple tabs
**Problem:** Opening game in two tabs causes state conflicts
**Current:** Not handled
**Future:** Use storage event listeners to sync or warn

### Issue: Browser back button
**Problem:** Not integrated with navigation
**Current:** Ignored
**Future:** Could use History API

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Online Multiplayer
- Use Supabase for real-time sync
- Rooms with join codes
- Multiple devices, one game
- Netlify integration available for Supabase

### Additional Features
- **LLM Word Generation**: Users provide their own API key (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **PWA Manifest**: Install as app on phone
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for actions
- **Confetti Animation**: On game completion
- **Export Stats**: Download game results
- **Custom Round Order**: Let users rearrange rounds
- **More Word Lists**: Expand default content

---

## Word List Format

Plain text files, one word per line:
```
# Comments start with #
Abraham Lincoln
Beyoncé
Harry Potter
Pizza
```

**Creating Custom Lists:**
- Save as `.txt` file
- One word/phrase per line
- Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- Upload via Word Input screen

---

## Deployment Notes

### Netlify Setup
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Build settings: Node 18+
5. No environment variables needed

### Other Platforms
Works on any static host:
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Any CDN

Just serve the `dist/` folder after running `npm run build`.

## Code Style & Conventions

### TypeScript
- Use strict types always
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for objects
- Use `readonly` for immutable state
- Explicit return types on public methods

### State Updates
- Always create new objects (immutability)
- Never mutate state directly
- Use spread operator for copies: `{...state, newProp: value}`

### Screen Classes
- Extend `BaseScreen`
- Implement `render(): HTMLElement | Promise<HTMLElement>`
- Use helper methods: `createButton()`, `createHeader()`, etc.
- Clean up listeners in `cleanup()` method if needed

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for classes and types
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
2. Ensure no unused variables/imports
3. Verify all files compile with strict mode

### LocalStorage Not Saving
1. Check browser storage quota
2. Verify no privacy mode blocking storage
3. Check console for errors

### Timer Issues
1. Verify Timer component is cleaned up on navigation
2. Check for multiple timers running simultaneously
3. Ensure state updates call `updateTimer()`

### Navigation Issues
1. Check ScreenManager has all screens registered
2. Verify screen factory functions are correct
3. Check for navigation loops
